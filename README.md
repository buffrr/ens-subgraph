# .forever Subgraph

This Subgraph sources events from the forever contracts.

# Example Queries

Here we have example queries, so that you don't have to type them in yourself eachtime in the graphiql playground:

```graphql
{
  domains {
    id
    labelName
    labelhash
    parent {
      id
    }
    subdomains {
      id
    }
    owner {
      id
    }
    resolver {
      id
    }
    ttl
  }
  resolvers {
    id
    address
    domain {
      id
    }
    events {
      id
      node
      ... on AddrChanged {
        a
      }
      ... on NameChanged {
        name
      }
      ... on AbiChanged {
        contentType
      }
      ... on PubkeyChanged {
        x
        y
      }
      ... on TextChanged {
        indexedKey
        key
      }
      ... on ContenthashChanged {
        hash
      }
      ... on InterfaceChanged {
        interfaceID
        implementer
      }
      ... on AuthorisationChanged {
        owner
        target
        isAuthorized
      }
    }
  }
}

```


### Generate deployment code

```bash

yarn prepare
```

you should see `subgraph.yaml` generated with correct mainnet addresses. Run codegen

```bash
yarn codegen
```

### Deploy

locally 

```bash
yarn create-local
yarn deploy-local
```

deploy to the graph:
```
